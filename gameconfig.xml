<!-- CONSTRUCTION MISSION PERAMETERS -->
<!-- These variables stop alien base construction missions being spawned too frequently - if this is removed then they will spawn in almost every UFO wave after they become available to the aliens. The delay values are the time (in days) that must elapse between two construction missions spawning. -->
