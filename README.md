# Welcome to Stukovphobia

This adds a lot of stuff to the game, but many things need to be applied manually through the config files after they trigger in game. I plan to write down the manual thingies at one point. But it is a growing list :)

It does merge several other mods, as i change quite some things. Including

X-Division naturally
German Weapons Pack
Jaz0 Soviet and Nato Weapons Pack
Xenophobia/XNT
XXP

Thanks to all creators for their works
